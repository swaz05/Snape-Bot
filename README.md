# Snape-Bot
AI based Chat Bot using Python

# ABSTRACT
Our project is divided into three sections. The first module was our minor project, and it involved building an AI-based chatbot utilizing the NLTK, rest api, and chatterbot corpus libraries. The main project consists of two modules, one of which extracts the user's audio and converts it into text using the Python text-to-speech library. This allows the chatbot to fetch the audio recording whenever the user issues an audio command, translate it into the appropriate text, and then carry out the command. With this module, customers or end users can easily interact with the chatbot by simply speaking commands to it, which reduces labor costs. The final module is a deep learning api installed within the chatbot so that it also acts as a virtual assistant. It has a default text format and can also be given audio instructions, it can be used for several purposes, mainly focusing but not limited to primarily aiding physically handicapped people and indisposed individuals.
